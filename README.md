# RandomPatheticRPG

This is a work in progress thing that will probably never be finished. I wanted to make a simple RPG with a battle system that includes
managing time and/or fatigue, and not things like MP.

For instance, if you have no fatigue, you are very likely to crit, but if you are very tired, you will generally perform worse.
